This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for Geologic Reservoir data. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Excel workbook documents a content model for information useful to characterize a subsurface reservoir for geothermal potential. The content model was created to provide a template for reservoir data gathered by the Texas BEG to be hosted by the NGDS. Provide a format that is clear and comprehesive so that it may be understood by fellow researchers in future studies. Also provide a standardized data template to allow for easy updating by multiple stakeholders and participants.

No services are yet deployed; approval of content model is awaited at the project working group share point site gdsdpwg.org.
