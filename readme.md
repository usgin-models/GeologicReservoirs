This repository contains documents for information useful to characterize a subsurface reservoir for geothermal potential. The content model was created to provide a template for reservoir data gathered by the Texas BEG to be hosted by the NGDS, and has been revised to incorporate fields needed for Play Fairway Analysis projects.                                                                                                                                               The intention is to provide format that is clear and comprehensive so that it may be understood by fellow researchers in future studies. Also provide a standardized data template to allow for easy updating by multiple stakeholders and participants.

Version 1.0 has been approved and is posted on schemas.usgin.org.
